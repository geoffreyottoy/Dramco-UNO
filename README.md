# Dramco-UNO
Dramco UNO - Low-Power and Low-Cost Arduino LoRa board

To burn the bootloader, follow the same procedure as described on https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/ArduinoISP (Use Arduino as ISP).
However, an extra wire is needed to tie pin 8 from the target (being the Dramco UNO) to 5V.
